# Aviation-Data-Insights-System (Using SQL)
This project builds an SQL-based aviation database to store, manage, and analyze flight, passenger, aircraft, airport, and booking data. It enables efficient querying, performance analysis, trend identification, and supports decision-making by transforming raw flight data into actionable insights.

# Introduction

The aviation sector generates massive volumes of operational data, including flights, airports, passengers, aircrafts, and bookings. Managing and analyzing this complex data manually is inefficient and error-prone.
To address this, the Aviation Data Insights System was developed using SQL. The project builds a structured relational database system that allows efficient storage, management, retrieval, and analysis of aviation data. It supports real-time insights into flight schedules, passenger activity, aircraft performance, booking patterns, and operational efficiency.

# Scope of the Project

This project covers:

Designing a complete aviation database

Creating tables with constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)

Modifying database structure with ALTER operations

Inserting, updating, and deleting records

Querying data using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Using GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions

Joining multiple tables for relational insights

Creating subqueries for advanced analytics

Building SQL views for simplified reporting

# SQL Topics Used

DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL: SELECT, DISTINCT

Conditions: WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE

Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

Aggregation: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN

Grouping: GROUP BY, HAVING

Subqueries: scalar, row, column-level

Set operations: UNION ALL

Views: CREATE VIEW

#Conclusion

The Aviation Data Insights System demonstrates the importance of SQL in managing and analyzing large-scale operational data. By organizing flights, passengers, airports, and bookings into a structured database, the system enables powerful querying, performance evaluation, and trend discovery.
The project not only highlights technical proficiency in SQL but also shows how data-driven insights support operational improvements, better passenger management, and strategic planning in the aviation industry.
